# Console 2D GameEngine {C2DGE} [0.1.0]

## By Grosse pastèque#6705

-------------

### The Project's Goal :

This projects was just a challenge so if you have bad reviews, it's normal but dont be suprised.
I am sure that I will update and upgrade it, so send your reviews to my discord: `Grosse pastèque#6705`
*Thank's*

This Game engine is simple and original, *it runs on a **terminal***.
But due to terminal low performances, some functionnalities are very hard to make (Gravity, fast movements and good fps).
If you think that this is a stupid idea, no problem go code your own game engine !
__**And I repeat myself but low perfomances are not due to this module**__

-------------

### Usage :

Originally it was supposed to support gravity and fast movements but for now it can't...
It supports only 2 dimensions in face and top view.

**__WARNING__: This modules uses `Advanced Variable Checker (AVC)` which requires typing modifications, go into `c2dge/modules/avc/__init__.py` for more informations !**

-------------

### Functionnalities :

| Functionnality  | Usage  |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| Window  | The core of your game  |
| Map  | Every game has a map where you can place your objects  |
| BackGround  | Map background  |
| Event  | A check that will be verified every loop  |
| Color  | The color core that does all image converting  |
| PixelCollision  | Collision with a pixel  |
| Collision  | Collision with any object that has the tag |
| Player  | Player object (**only object that can have actions**)  |
| Entity  | Like a player but can't have actions  |
| Object  | Same as an entity but can be fixed to not be affected by gravity |
| *Gravity*  | Gravity engine *only for face view* (**Experimental**)  |

*There is also some other functions but there are not very important for simple games.*

------------

### Functionnalities that arrives soon :

| Saver  | to save your game in data format.  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Gravity**  | **not sure but I will try my best...**  |

------------

### Examples :

I have created three examples to help you understand a bit more if you want.
In [Here](./examples/).

------------

### Tested on :

| System  | Python  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Windows 10 | Python 3.9.0  |

**Will be tested on Linux soon**

------------

### Requirements :

| Module name  | module version  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| webcolors  | =< 1.11.1  |
| opencv-python  | =< 4.5.1  |
| numpy  | =< 1.20.1  |

------------

### Informations :

The module `Advanced Variable Checker (AVC)` is not actually disponible beacause it requires a bit more tests and upgrades.

------------

### The Challenge :

This challenge consited in creating a game engine in one week and four days of deadlines to finish.
Personnaly I have learn a lot of things and tricks so if you have the experience and the determination you can try, and good luck !
